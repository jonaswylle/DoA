Operated in the Heapside Neighborhood of Baldur's Gate by [[Jabazz]] and [[Qurmilla]]. A walled-in garden, three tubs, 2 massage rooms. After hours, the [[Dead Three Cultists]] access their [[Sewer - Cultist Hideout]] via a secret door.

Jabazz appears to be in league with the cultists, while Curmilla seems aware but uninvolved.

##### Events

- The party spent a long time snooping around, Jonas and Spark did not enter while the owners were present. They ended up sneaking in after the house closed and entering the [[Sewer - Cultist Hideout]].
- Upon leaving the hideout, they find [[Qurmilla]] dead and the rest of the bathhouse empty.
- Party is approached by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Filo tells them Zephyr stole a mask, and Jonas persuades them to lighten the mood.
