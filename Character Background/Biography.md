Jonas was born in Elturel in 1455. His father was a Paladin of Torm, in whose footsteps he followed. His father disappeared in the events of Fort Morninglord, and the lack of justice/response to this disappearance began his disillusionment with the dominant faith of Torm. He was given the opportunity to join the Hellriders but does not trust them and does not take it. In 1487, after Helm was reborn, he converted and left Elturel for Cormyr, where he retrained as a Paladin of Helm when Kleef Kenric became Helm's chosen. A couple years later, he was dispatched to the southern jungles that had recently reappeared from the events of the Spellplague in the service of a outpost temple to Helm. There, he witnessed a harsh and mysterious land where his fellow clerics and paladins were mistrusted by the locals and they themselves mistreated the wild dwarves they claimed to be seeking to convert. In 1491, the outpost is overrun in the night and he escaped to Narubel in Thindol, where he is able to get passage on a ship for Baldur's gate. There, hoping to return to the Shieldhall of Helm in Elturel for debriefing, he meets up with the group.
